# EXAM 2

## Tasks

* Write test cases for `SudokuBoard`.
* Write test cases for `SudokuSolver`.
* Implement `SudokuBoard`.
* Implement `SudokuSolver`.

## Grading

Do NOT worry if you cannot implement `SudokuSolver`. 
I expect very few people to finish it.
I'll test your solver with **EASY** boards only.
A board is said to be easy if it is already solved,
or always contains at least one cell that has a single candidate
value. 

### Weights:

* Quality (i.e. cleanness and coverage) of test cases: 40%
* Cleanness of `SudokuBoard`: 20%
* Correctness and completeness of `SudokuBoard`: 20%
* Cleanness of `SudokuSolver`: 10%
* Correctness and completeness of `SudokuSolver`: 10%
